# Security Policy
As is specified in the README.md, the project's source code are of my authory. <br/>
So, if you find vulnerabilities, please report it to the project and respective author. <br />

In the case that the projects already fix the issue take in consideration that many of them are in git submodules (a git repo inside another git). <br />
So, please be patient to the author mirror that change to the git's repos. If the vulnerability are in the tarball (becuase my version is outdated) please inform me and I will update it ASAP.
