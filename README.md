# LinuxFromScratch-Sources
Repositorie of LinuxFromScratch's sources needed for build your own Linux following LFS/CLFS documentation.

Take in consideration this; I'm NOT the owner and developper of this software. Most of them come from GNU Project. <br/>
This repositorie only have the target to concentrate the sources codes needed to build your LinuxFromScratch base, also this is needed for Cross Linux From Scratch.
